On this site I have posted brief information about some software crafts that I developed in my free time.    

These are __FLibGoLite__, __Pixyne__ and __Burnfix__.  
For your convenience, they are all available for __Windows__, __macOS__ and __Linux__, both as precompiled executables and in source code.     

I hope some of them will be useful to you.  
Use them for your pleasure and share with friends.

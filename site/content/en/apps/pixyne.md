{{< /carousel >}}

Pixyne application has a simple and intuitive interface:   
* With a click on photo you can mark to drop it in the trash.
* In Advanced mode you may also set or correct the EXIF shooting date crop the size and ajust selected photo.
* When you save changes, you can change all file names to EXIF shooting date format.  
* Changes will not be applied until you save. Pixyne automaticaly stores the current state of the folder so you can undo changes at any time. This is useful when working with a large number of photos and you need to close the application in order to continue working later and resume from the same place.

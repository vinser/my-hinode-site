**Try to fix screen image retentions and burn in, look for screen defects**
{{< image src="img/testgrid-16x9.jpg" ratio="16x9" caption="Figure caption" class="rounded" >}}

After turning off or moving the taskbar, you suddenly find that the logo in the corner of the screen and the search magnifier are still visible on your monitor or TV screen, although not as brightly.

This is the so-called **image retention** or **burn-in**.

This application can attempt to get rid of this effect on your LCD, LED or plasma screen by showing a special moving Signal Pattern for a period of time.

Moreover, burnfix can show full-screen images of various colors to help you identify defects in the display matrix.   

Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found on the {{< link href=burnfix_site external=true >}}product website{{< /link >}}  

Enjoy!
